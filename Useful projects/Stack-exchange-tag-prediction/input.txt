JQuery AJAX: prevent the delay caused due to set interval function
I am keeping a live track on no. of users in my system, for that I am using javascript's setInterval() function, following is the code:

function fetchdis() {
$.ajax({
    url: "/count/dist",
    dataType: "json"
}).success(function(data){
    $('#val_dis').html(JSON.stringify(data.sum));
});
}
setInterval(function () {fetchdis()}, 3000);
everything is working properly except I am getting a delay of 3 seconds also first time when I am loading the data(resulting into an empty space), I do not want that interval the first time the data loads.

Thank you for your help
